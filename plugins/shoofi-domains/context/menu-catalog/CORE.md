# Menu / Catalog — CORE (always read)

Products, categories, menu assembly, options/extras, availability & stock, catalog i18n.

## Scope
Server: `routes/menu.js`, `routes/product.js`, `routes/category.js`, the catalog slice of
`routes/store.js`, `routes/translations.js`, `routes/global-search.js`, `utils/menu-cache.js`,
`utils/order-stock.js` (stock semantics only). Docs: `docs/stock-management.md`,
`docs/menu-search.md`.
Mostly **server-first**: catalog data is server-owned and clients render it — but if a task
needs a client change (partner product screens, customer menu display), do it full-stack,
one PR per repo.
**Not yours:** order creation/status, payments, delivery, auth. ⚠️ `utils/order-stock.js` is
**shared with the order flow** (called on confirm/cancel) — treat edits there as a review
boundary and say so in the PR.

## Invariants — never weaken
1. **Multi-tenant scoping:** every query goes through
   `const db = await getOrInitializeDb(req.headers['app-name'], req.app.db)`.
   Central = `req.app.db['shoofi']`. A wrong DB leaks one store's catalog into another —
   the worst failure in this domain.
2. **CACHE RULE — any write that changes menu output MUST clear BOTH keys:**
   `menuCache.clearStore(appName)` **and** `menuCache.clearStore(\`${appName}_schoolProject\`)`.
   Missing one serves a stale menu for up to the 5-minute TTL. Menu cache is **customer-only** —
   admin/partner bypass it, so never add caching there (hidden products would leak).
3. **Displayed price is derived at READ time** from the category's `discountPercent` (max across
   the product's categories). The stored `product.price` is **not** what the customer sees.
4. **Stock invariant** (stock-managed stores, `store.isStockManagment`): `quantity <= 0` ⟺
   `{ isInStore:false, outOfStockByQuantity:true }`. **Human-confirmed: applies to ALL products,
   no exceptions.** Decrement only on order confirmation; restore only re-enables products that
   were `outOfStockByQuantity` (never un-hides a manual disable).
5. **`supportedCategoryIds` are STRINGS**, compared via `{$toString:'$_id'}`. Don't switch to
   ObjectId comparison without a data migration.
6. **Product ordering** comes from `categoryOrders[categoryId]`, falling back to legacy `order`.
7. **General categories are read from the PER-STORE DB, gated by the PER-STORE store doc.**
   The tiles are `<appName>.general-categories`; the link is
   `<appName>.categories[].supportedGeneralCategoryIds`, which holds **strings** compared
   against `_id.toString()` (`routes/menu.js:178-183`) — an ObjectId there matches nothing.
   The master switch is `hasGeneralCategories` on `<appName>.store`, **never** the mirror of
   the same name on `shoofi.stores` (`routes/menu.js:169`). `shoofi.stores.supportedGeneralCategoryIds`
   is written in four places and **read by none** — it is inert; do not diagnose from it.
   Don't confuse any of this with `shoofi.general-categories`, which is the marketplace
   taxonomy behind the Explore home screen (`routes/category.js`), a different feature.
8. **`<appName>.store` is a SINGLETON — match it as `{}`, never as `{ id: 1 }`.**
   ~75 reads still do `db.store.findOne({ id: 1 })` with the **number** 1. Mongo compares types
   strictly, so a doc saved with the string `"1"` matches none of them and the store silently
   half-dies — nulls, not errors. It gets saved that way because `POST /api/store/update`
   (`routes/store.js`) `$set`s the client body verbatim and admin form values arrive as strings;
   both write paths now pin it through `storeService.normalizeStoreId`
   (`utils/store-service.js`), and `scripts/normalize-store-id.js` repairs existing rows.
   This was live: one store lost its entire general-categories strip because
   `routes/menu.js` dereferenced that null inside a `try/catch` that swallowed it.

## Known status (human-confirmed — do NOT "fix")
- **BY DESIGN:** translations resolve to the **central** DB — UI labels are global/platform-wide,
  not per-store. Do **not** re-route them to `app-name`.
- **FACT (not a bug):** `supportedCategoryIds` are strings (invariant 5).
- **Backlog (confirmed, safe to act on when asked):**
  1. `GET /api/menu` and `POST /api/menu/refresh` build the menu **differently** — `refresh` is a
     real admin-triggered action that re-caches under the same key, so clicking it degrades the
     live menu. Fix by extracting **one shared menu-builder** both call.
  2. Remove the dead lunr index (`lib/indexing.js` + its `indexProducts` call sites) — it indexes
     fields the schema doesn't have and runs on every product write. Touches product-write paths;
     test after.
- **Recorded risk, not yours to fix:** the server trusts client-sent extras prices (no server-side
  recompute). Any fix lives in the order-create path — hand off.

## Recipe — add/modify a product field
1. Server: accept + persist it in the product insert/update handlers (`routes/product.js`).
2. **Expose it** in the `$project` blocks of the menu aggregation (`routes/menu.js`) or the client
   will never see it.
3. **Clear both cache keys** on every write path you touched (invariant 2).
4. Client (if needed): partner edit UI, customer display.
5. Verify: `npm run lint` (0 errors), `npm run routes:check` if routes moved, tests via the
   `shoofi-testing` cover-changes skill.

## Definition of done
Inherit `_shared-guardrails.md` §7. Here specifically: name every write path you touched and
confirm each clears both cache keys; never claim `smoke` passed without infra; fix the doc +
`context/assert/menu-catalog.assert.json` in the same PR if you find drift.
