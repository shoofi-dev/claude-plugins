# Accountant — CORE (always read)

**Money OUT + the books:** what stores and delivery companies/drivers are owed, tax
invoices, and bank payouts. Distinct from `payments` (money IN).

## Scope
Server: `routes/payments/{admin-reports,admin,summaries}.js`, `routes/driver-reports.js`,
`routes/admin/masav.js`, `routes/hyp.js` (EZcount invoicing), `lib/payments/calc.js`,
`utils/{vat,greeninvoice,invoice-provider}.js`. Client: the reports/payout screens in
`shoofi-delivery-web`.
**🔒 CLAUDE.md do-not-touch overlap:** `routes/hyp.js`, `utils/hyp.js`,
`utils/invoice-provider.js`, `lib/payments/`. You depend on `routes/order.js` for order
amounts but **never edit it**.
**Not yours:** charge acceptance/tokenization = `payments`; driver assignment = `delivery`.

## The mental model — CASH vs CARD (hold this before touching anything)
A customer pays `items + delivery + driveIn`. What happens next depends on **who physically
collected the money**:
- **CARD** → **Shoofi** captured it and is the hub: it pays the store its revenue (minus
  commission etc.) and pays the driver the delivery fee — outward, via MASAV.
- **CASH** → the **driver collected at the door**; it never touches Shoofi. The driver
  **keeps the delivery fee in cash** (`actualDriverPayment = 0` from Shoofi) and **owes the
  store the items money**. Shoofi still earns commission on cash orders — it recovers that by
  **deducting it from the store's card-based bank transfer**.

**Consequence:** a store's transfer is computed from **credit-card revenue only, minus ALL
outcomes** (including commission on cash orders). A mostly-cash store can have a **negative
balance** (owes Shoofi) → settled via a credit note (docType 330).

## Invariants — never weaken
1. **The transfer formula** (`generateStoreReportData` in `routes/payments/admin-reports.js`):
   `totalForTransfer = creditCardRevenue + driveInCreditCard − totalOutcomes`;
   `balance = totalForTransfer` — **no VAT adjustment, for any `businessType`**.
   `totalForInvoice = creditCardRevenue + driveInCreditCard`.
   **`exempt` (עוסק פטור) does NOT mean ÷1.18.** Such a store charges no VAT, so the
   collected price has no VAT component to strip — ₪100 taken on the card is ₪100 owed.
   The store invoices Shoofi for that same undivided amount (`vatType: 'NON'`, docType
   300 receipt, `routes/hyp.js` create-store-invoice), so payment and tax document
   reconcile. **They move together or not at all** — dividing one and not the other
   leaves the store paid ~15% off what its own document says.
   (Changed 2026-08-03; both were previously ÷1.18. `routes/driver-reports.js` still
   applies the old ÷1.18 rule to exempt **delivery companies** — deliberately left
   pending a separate decision, so the two payout paths currently disagree.)
2. **`actualDriverPayment` cash-vs-card branch** (`routes/driver-reports.js`): CARD → full
   `effectiveDeliveryFee`; CASH + coupon → the coupon-covered amount; **CASH, no coupon → 0**.
   A bug here **double-pays a driver who already pocketed the cash**.
3. **Commission base is the FINAL items price actually charged** — `order.orderPrice`,
   after the store's own product discounts. Store commission is **tiered**
   (`calculateCommissionTiered`, from `store.accounting.contract.commissionTiers`); the flat
   15% in dashboards is **not** the authoritative settlement number.
   `stores-export-new` carries both `totalRevenueCreditCard/Cash` (= what Shoofi captured)
   and `totalProductDiscount*` (= `originalPrice − orderPrice`). **The product discount is
   reported for visibility only** — it enters neither `revenueForCommission` nor
   `totalIncomes` / `totalForTransfer` / `totalForInvoice`. A store discounting its own
   items therefore reduces Shoofi's cut proportionally, and that is intended.
   Still **inside** the commission base: coupon money Shoofi reimburses to the store
   (`totalCustomerSpecificCoupons`), Shoofi compensations, and drive-in. Coins are
   commissioned separately at `coinsCommissionPercent`.
   *History — do not "restore" either half:* until 2026-08-03 revenue itself used the
   pre-discount price, which overstated a discounting store's transfer and tax invoice;
   that was fixed. The pre-discount **commission** base survived that fix and was then
   dropped by owner decision on **2026-08-04** ("commission only from the final order
   items price after discount").
4. **VAT has ONE source of truth: `utils/vat.js`** (`VAT_RATE`, `VAT_MULTIPLIER`,
   `calculateVAT`, `withoutVAT`, `withoutVATIfExempt`, `isVatExempt`). **Never re-introduce
   a `0.18`/`1.18` literal** — divergent rounding points silently skew payouts.
   `isVatExempt(...storeDocs)` is the one way to ask whether a business is עוסק פטור: it
   reads `accounting.bankAccount.businessType` off **either** the per-tenant `store {id:1}`
   doc or the `shoofi.stores` registry entry, because production stores are inconsistent
   about which one carries it. Do not re-inline the `businessType === 'exempt'` comparison.
   **Exempt is no longer a settlement-only concern:** since 2026-08-09 the per-order
   CUSTOMER document follows it too (zero VAT on both gateways) — that half belongs to the
   `payments` domain, invariant 9. A change to what `exempt` means now moves two systems.
5. **Report guards must stay on:** duplicate + **overlap across ALL statuses** (a sent report
   blocks a new overlapping one), orders-closed, and compensations-approved.
   **Delete is deliberately NOT status-gated** — a report can be sent and only then found
   wrong, and the fix is delete + regenerate. But delete **must release the carry-over
   compensations** that `/send` consumed (`appNameBackfill.pendingReportCarryover` back to
   `true`), or the regenerated report silently drops those amounts.
6. **Settlement reads the store `orders` collection** (which has status), never the
   `customers.orders[]` snapshot. Keep it that way.
7. **A store's coupon cost (`reportData.campaigns`) is the coupon's NOMINAL
   `storeDiscount`, never the waiver the customer actually got**, and the gate that
   decides it is **blind to `discountType`** (`routes/payments/admin.js:1135-1142`,
   feeding `totalAppliedCouponsSum` → `campaignsTotal` → `campaigns`):
   `if (storeDiscount && !isSpecificToCustomers && discountType !== 'full_discount')`.
   Three consequences that keep getting rediscovered:
   - **No cap against the thing discounted.** `storeDiscount: 20` on a ₪10 shipping fee
     bills the store ₪20, even though `appliedCoupon.discountAmount` was capped at ₪10
     when the coupon was applied. Any read-time "who paid for this" derivation therefore
     produces a small **negative** Shoofi share on such orders. That is real over-billing
     surfacing — **do not clamp it at zero**, which only hides it.
   - **A `percentage`-type coupon is billed as `(storeDiscount / 100) * orderPrice`**,
     where `orderPrice` is the **items subtotal** (`originalOrderPrice` — no shipping, no
     drive-in) — *even when the coupon's `discountType` is `delivery`*. So what the
     store report charges for a percentage delivery coupon is not a delivery amount.
     **A percentage `storeDiscount` means a SHARE, not an amount** (owner ruling,
     2026-08-12): the delivery fee differs from city to city, so the same coupon must
     cost the store more where the fee is higher, which a fixed shekel value cannot
     express. `couponDeliverySplit` (`lib/payments/calc.js`) therefore takes that
     percentage off the **delivery waiver**, and **deliberately diverges from
     `:1137-1138` for these coupons**. `isPercentageStoreDeliveryCoupon` counts them so
     the divergence is measurable (`percentageShareCoupons` on the exec-dashboard month
     detail) rather than invisible. Fixing the report's base to match is a **live
     billing change** — it moves what stores are charged, and belongs to its own ticket.
   - **The row pushed at `:1145` carries no items/delivery split** (unlike the
     `full_discount` rows at `:1236`), so `campaignsList` is not splittable for
     `delivery`/`order_items` coupons. `full_discount` is the **only** coupon type with a
     stored 2×2 split (`getFullDiscountMatrix`); everything else must be re-derived from
     the order at read time — see `couponDeliverySplit` in `lib/payments/calc.js`.
   `campaigns` is an **outcome** feeding `totalOutcomes` → `totalForTransfer`, so this is
   live money. Do not "fix" the percentage base as a side effect of another change — it
   moves what stores are charged. **Ask.**
   *(Do not mirror `admin.js:907-944` either — that is the legacy `/stores-export`
   endpoint, which bills `storeDiscount` for every coupon including customer-specific and
   `full_discount`. Settlement uses `/stores-export-new`.)*

## Known status (human-confirmed — do NOT "fix")
- **FIXED, keep it that way:** the overlap guard now covers sent reports; VAT is centralized
  in `utils/vat.js`.
- **INTENTIONAL, do NOT "restore":** delete accepts **any** report status (2026-08-03). The
  old "only draft reports can be deleted" guard was removed on purpose so a wrong report that
  already went out to a store/driver can be regenerated. Deleting a report that carries an
  issued tax invoice only **warns** (logging `hypInvoiceDocUuid`, needed by
  `/api/hyp/admin/reports/:id/cancel-invoice` once the row is gone) — cancelling or
  credit-noting at the provider stays a separate, manual step.
- **OPEN — flagged, needs a decision:** `reset-invoice` only clears the *local* invoice fields;
  it does **not** cancel the document at GreenInvoice/HYP, so a following `create-invoice`
  issues a **second** invoice. Do not silently change behavior — ask.
- **Awareness:** MASAV is **decoupled** from the reports — payout amounts are re-keyed into an
  Excel by a human; there is no automated report→MASAV link. Hardcoded GreenInvoice
  `businessId`/`itemId` constants exist.

## Recipe — change a payout or invoice amount
1. **Trace the money first**: who collected (cash/card) → who is owed → which formula line.
   Write that trace in the PR body. If you can't trace it, don't change it.
2. Change the **one** formula line; never introduce a new rounding or VAT point.
3. Show a **before/after worked example** for one real report period.
4. Verify: `npm run lint` (0 errors), `docs:check`, and a dry run of report generation if infra
   allows. Never claim an invoice/MASAV change is correct without a sandbox.

## Definition of done
Inherit `_shared-guardrails.md` §7, plus: preserve the transfer formula, the cash-vs-card
branch, the pre-discount commission base, and invoice idempotency guards. When in doubt on
real money, **stop and ask**.
