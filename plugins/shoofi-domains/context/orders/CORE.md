# Orders — CORE (always read)

The money/identity spine: order creation, the status lifecycle, twin orders, tracking.
Read `reference.md` when you need the endpoint tables, the full data model, or the
per-repo client sections.

## Scope
**Yours:** order creation, status transitions, twin orders, order reads/admin/monitoring,
customer order history, order crons, and the order-side wiring of secondary features
(coins, world-cup, attribution, coupon usage).
Server: `routes/order.js`, `routes/twin-order.js`, `routes/order-fraud-*.js`,
`routes/admin/order-monitoring.js`, `services/twin-order/*`, `utils/order-stock.js`,
order crons. Clients: checkout+tracking (app), accept/prepare (partner), pickup/deliver
(shoofir), monitoring/twin-admin (delivery-web).

**Not yours:** payment internals (`payments`), settlement/payouts (`accountant`), driver
assignment & areas (`delivery`), auth (`customers`). Hand off in the PR.

## ⚠️ HIGH-RISK — draft PR, flagged, never merge
Order creation (`processCreditCardPayment`/`processHypTokenPayment`/`finalizeApplePayOrder`
paths in `routes/order.js`), **any status-transition code**, and twin place/pay/cancel/degrade.
You may change them: minimal diff, extra tests, a "what could break" section, rollback note.
Payments/invoicing files stay off-limits — describe the fix and hand off.

## Invariants — never weaken
1. **Status source of truth is the server** — `ORDER_STATUS` in `consts/consts.js`
   (`1` in-progress … `6` pending … `13` fraud-review, `14` future, `15` ramadan; completed
   bucket `2,3,10,11,12`, cancelled `4,5,7,8,9`). Each client repo keeps its **own copy** in
   `consts/shared.ts` — a status change is a **multi-repo PR**.
2. **Transition guards:** PENDING(`6`) only from FRAUD_REVIEW; store-accept rejects
   already-cancelled; `start-preparing` only from `14`. **ACCEPT is `order/update/viewd`**,
   not `order/update`.
3. **Stock idempotency:** `decrementOrderStock`/`restoreOrderStock` gated on
   `stockDecremented && !stockRestored` + `store.isStockManagment`. Decrement **only** on
   confirmation — a failed charge must never consume stock.
4. **Payment idempotency:** Apple Pay finalize is an atomic `findOneAndUpdate({status:"0"})`;
   the ZCredit callback can arrive **before** the order exists (self-heal path). Twin = one
   combined capture.
5. **`customers.orders[]` is a create-time snapshot with NO status.** Never infer
   completion/revenue from it — join the store `orders` collection. Reuse
   `getSuccessfulOrdersByCustomerIds` (`utils/customer-orders.js`). See `docs/customer-orders-snapshot.md`.
6. **Secondary never breaks primary** — coins, world-cup, attribution, notifications are
   try/caught and swallowed. Never let one throw into the order path.
7. **Multi-tenant:** orders live in the **store** DB (`getOrInitializeDb(app-name)`);
   **customers are central** (`shoofi`). Don't cross them.
8. **Twin peers** are mutated by `services/twin-order/*` directly, never via
   `/api/order/update` (recursion).
9. **`isFutureOrder`/`isRamadanIftar` are written only when TRUE — never `false`.** Both come
   from one client-side `orderTimingMode` (`shoofi-app/screens/checkout/index.tsx`) and are
   attached conditionally in `submitOrder` (`shoofi-app/stores/cart/index.ts`), so on a
   same-day order the fields are **absent**, not `false`. They are **mutually exclusive** — a
   ramadan-iftar order can be up to `MAX_RAMADAN_DAYS_AHEAD` = 3 days ahead
   (`shoofi-app/components/checkout/FutureOrderPicker.tsx`) and never carries `isFutureOrder`.
   "Is this order for a later day?" must therefore test **both**, **truthily** — as the server
   does (`routes/order.js`: `$or: [{isFutureOrder:{$ne:true}},{isFutureOrder:{$exists:false}}]`).
   Testing `isFutureOrder` alone silently misses every ramadan order.
10. **A store delay ACCUMULATES the live fields and freezes the originals ONCE — and
    `delayMinutes` is never a running total.** `POST /api/order/update-delay`
    (`routes/order.js`) writes three preserve-once fields (`order.originalOrderDate`, and on the
    `bookDelivery` row `originalPickupTime` + `originalExpectedDeliveryAt`, each written as
    `existing || current`) beside three that accumulate (`orderDate`, `pickupTime`,
    `expectedDeliveryAt`). `delayMinutes` on **both** documents is overwritten with the LAST
    declared delay: after 10 then 10 it reads `10`, not `20`. Total accumulated delay is only
    recoverable by diffing an original against its live twin — anything summing `delayMinutes`
    is wrong on every twice-delayed order.
    Two consequences that have already caused bugs, both in reporting rather than here:
    (a) `pickupTime` is deliberately **not** wrapped at 24, so `"24:05"` is a real stored value
    and a `HH:mm` parser that rejects it discards the row; (b) a promise and a pickup clock must
    be compared **within the same era** — the frozen promise against the frozen clock, or the
    live against the live. Mixing them makes a zero-minute ETA sentinel
    (`services/delivery/late-delivery.js`) look like a genuine promise and vice versa, which is
    exactly what `originalExpectedDeliveryAt` exists to prevent. Delivery owns the reading rule;
    orders owns the fields, and this is the contract between them.

## Where an order that never happened lives
**There is no server-side cart.** The cart is MobX + AsyncStorage in
`shoofi-app/stores/cart/index.ts` and nothing about it reaches the server until submit, so
"the customer built a cart and left" exists ONLY as events in central **`shoofi.apps-logs`**
(written by `routes/app-logs.js`). Three layers answer "abandoned", an order of magnitude
apart — always establish which is meant:

1. **Blocked before submit** — `checkout_validation_failed`, `properties.step` ∈
   {`store_closed`, `store_closed_select_time`, `shipping_method_invalid`, `address_invalid`,
   `payment_method_invalid`, `car_details_missing`, `future_order_date_missing`}, from
   `shoofi-app/hooks/checkout/use-checkout-validate.ts`. **"Store closed" and "no delivery
   available" create NO order document at all** — this is their only record anywhere. The
   top-level failure in `screens/checkout/index.tsx` sends no `step`, so ~half the rows have
   none; bucket them rather than dropping them.
2. **Submitted and never paid** — status `"0"` order rows, per store DB. See the
   `FAILED_PAYMENT_STATUS` note; that is the only layer carrying an issuer reason.
3. **Never reached checkout** — `page_viewed` with `properties.page_name` ∈
   {`ProductAddToCart`, `Cart`} and no `order_submit_success`. Add-to-cart uses
   `trackPageView`, not `trackEvent`, so it is a `page_viewed` row and easy to miss.

Traps that cost a day if you meet them cold:
- **`apps-logs.created` is a real BSON `Date`** — the exact opposite of `orders.created`. One
  query cannot span both, and mixing them matches nothing and raises nothing.
- **The only indexes are `_id` and `{userId, created}`.** A match on `created` alone is a full
  scan of a ~4.6 GB collection. Bound `_id` instead (`ObjectId.createFromTime`, widened by a
  minute and re-filtered on `created`) — index-covered, and roughly 50× faster.
- **No TTL and no retention job**, so history is complete back to the first event on
  **2026-02-06**. Anything earlier is *no data*, not zero — report it as null.
- **No `appName` field on the document**, so a per-store split is impossible from this data.
  `app_type` is always `"shoofi-shopping"`: the partner and driver apps do not log at all.
- **The launch event is not a usable "app open".** `ota_check_started` (`trigger: "launch"`,
  `shoofi-app/hooks/useOTAUpdates.ts`) fires before `userDetailsStore` hydrates, so ~99% of
  launch rows carry `userId: null`, and it only exists from 2026-07-29.
- **"Did they actually use it?" = did the device-day emit anything that is NOT `ota_*`.** The
  OTA hook is the only writer in the client that is not a user action (it fires on mount and
  on an `AppState` resume, then emits its check/download consequences). There is no background
  execution path at all — no registered task, no headless JS, no silent-push handler, and the
  server never sends `content-available` — so nothing runs while the app is away, and an
  `ota_*`-only device-day is "came to the front, nothing was looked at". Note `page_viewed` is
  NOT a clean "a screen rendered" proxy: `StoreSelectAuto` fires during boot with no screen,
  `ProductAddToCart` is a button press, and `Menu1`/`Menu2` sit outside their `isFocused`
  guard so they fire on blur too (`shoofi-app/screens/menu/menu.tsx`).
- **`user_visit_id` IS a stable identity** — the `device-id` header, generated once into
  AsyncStorage and **not cleared on logout** — measured at 97.9% one device per customer. Do
  not confuse it with `orders.deviceId`, which prefers the per-order `unique_hash` and churns
  every order.
- **⚠️ `userId: null` does NOT mean "logged out"** — it means *we did not learn who this was*.
  `userDetailsStore.userDetails` is in-memory only and filled by a network round-trip, so a
  fully signed-in customer emits `userId: null` for a whole session in three cases: events
  fired before that call returns; a token-hydration race where `authStore.isLoggedIn()` is
  still false when `App.tsx`'s `prepare()` tests it, so `getUserDetails()` is never called at
  all for that run; and a failed or timed-out call, which is **never retried**. So any
  "anonymous" figure is an **upper bound**, and must be labelled in devices or sessions rather
  than people. Resolve identity across the whole (device × business day) — if any event that
  day carried a `userId`, the day is that customer — which drops measured anonymity from ~99%
  on the launch event to ~12%. Keep it as a SET: a device can carry two customers in a day.
- **Impersonation is invisible in this data.** A `master` operator can drive the app as a
  customer (`shoofi-app/stores/auth/impersonation.ts`) and `trackEvent` sends no impersonation
  marker, so those sessions are indistinguishable from the real customer's and inflate any
  unique-user count.
- **`POST /api/app-logs/insert` is unauthenticated and takes `userId` from the body.** A
  product metric, never an auditable one.
- Logging is killable per store via `isAppLogsEnabled`, and the collection handle is bound to
  `db.driversBonuses` by `DatabaseInitializationService` — always use
  `db.collection('apps-logs')` explicitly.

Worked example: `services/exec-dashboard/engagement-metrics.js`.

## An order can be written into the WRONG store's DB — and the app already tells you
`app-name` on `POST /api/order/create` comes from the customer app's **cart store snapshot**,
not from the products in the cart, so a cart of store A's products can be submitted into store
B's database. It is rare and it is real: **10** submits since 2026-02-12 went out on a store
other than the one the customer was browsing (e.g. `burger-hmod` `0156-0705`, 2026-09-14, two
`aldo` products; the customer re-placed the identical basket at `aldo` six minutes later as
`3540-1705`). **None of them was a twin order.**

**Do not reconstruct this from the items.** The client instruments it directly, in
`shoofi.apps-logs`:

```js
// both are event_type values; `properties` holds the comparison
{ event_type: "checkout_store_data_check",     "properties.stores_match": false }
{ event_type: "order_submit_store_data_check", "properties.all_stores_match": false }
```

`checkout_store_data_check` (`shoofi-app/screens/checkout/index.tsx`, the mount effect that
calls `cartStore.getCartStoreData`) compares the cart's store to the store being browsed;
`order_submit_store_data_check` (`shoofi-app/stores/cart/index.ts` `submitOrder`) adds the
store actually going on the order. Read `cart_store_app_name` vs `current_store_app_name` to
see which way the drift ran.

**The match flags are dominated by a benign case — filter it out or you will overcount by
16x.** `stores_match`/`all_stores_match` are also false when the cart simply has no snapshot
yet (`cart_store_app_name: null`), which is the ordinary path and which checkout already
handles by falling back to the live store data. Of 145,830 checkout events, 270 are false but
248 are that; only **22** have both stores present and different. Of 90,594 submit events, 171
are false, 161 are that, and **10** are a real wrong-store routing. So:

```js
{ event_type: "order_submit_store_data_check",
  "properties.order_vs_current_match": false,
  "properties.cart_stored_app_name": { $ne: null } }   // 10 rows, all of 2026
```

Why the drift exists: the cart's store identity is kept in **two** AsyncStorage keys that
nobody keeps in sync. `@storage_cart_storeDB` is the authority — every repair path maintains
it (`addProductToCart`, `resetCartForNewStore`, `hooks/useReorder.ts`, and the twin flow reads
it first). `@storage_cart_storeData` is a cache of that store's details, written once by
`addProductToCart` from whatever `storeDataStore` held at the time, and **checkout routes on
the cache** — `app-name`, the delivery quote, the coupon check and `order.storeData` all read
`cartStoreData || storeDataStore.storeData`. `getCartStoreData` now detects a snapshot that
contradicts the authority, substitutes the live store doc when that doc names the authority's
store, and logs `cart_store_data_stale` with `corrected: true|false`.

**It deliberately does NOT return null on a drift, and neither should any future version of
it.** Two consumers have no fallback of their own: `screens/checkout/index.tsx` bails out of
the delivery-quote effect on `!cartStoreData?.location`, and `components/total-price/index.tsx`
sets `cartStoreLocation` to null. A null there means `availableDrivers` is never fetched, which
blocks delivery checkout outright (`use-checkout-validate.ts` then fails with
`delivery-not-available-for-this-address`) and, on a future/iftar order — which skips that
validation — ships `shippingPrice: 0`. When the drift cannot be corrected the stale snapshot is
returned unchanged, which is the pre-guard behaviour, and `corrected: false` says so.

**The twin secondary basket is not involved.** `twinCartStore`
(`shoofi-app/stores/twin-cart/index.ts`) is a separate class on separate keys —
`@storage_twinCartItems` / `@storage_twin_cart_storeDB` / `@storage_twin_cart_storeData` — with
its own `getCartStoreData`. `twinOrderStore.setSecondaryStore` writes its name and data keys
from the same `store` object, and the twin-promotion path in `screens/cart/cart.tsx` (secondary
promoted to primary when the primary basket empties) writes the primary pair together too. The
pair can only drift where one key is written without the other, which is why the reorder path
was the one that produced it.

Two traps when you go looking:
- **The reasons are only as good as the first item.** `checkOrderItemsStore`
  (`routes/order-fraud-detector.js`) inspects `items[0]` **only**, so the Hebrew fraud reason
  `פריט הזמנה "X" לא נמצא במוצרי החנות (<appName>)` is the platform's de-facto wrong-store
  signal but misses an order whose first item happens to exist in the target store. Template
  stores share **byte-identical product `_id`s** (`create-from-mock` preserves them), so
  between two template-derived stores the lookup returns a plausible product and the check
  passes.
- **A retrospective catalogue sweep cannot confirm it.** Checking an old order's items against
  `products` today conflates "came from another store" with "deleted since": 105 of 48,866
  orders since 2026-06-01 have a missing item, but only a handful were ever flagged at creation
  time. Use the `apps-logs` events, which were recorded at the moment it happened.

## Known status (human-confirmed — do NOT "fix")
- **BY DESIGN:** `verifiedAppName` in `routes/order.js` is a pass-through; the multi-tenant
  cross-check is intentionally disabled. Leave it.
- **BY DESIGN:** fraud **rejection** is intentionally off — risky orders route to
  FRAUD_REVIEW(`13`) for manual handling. Do not enable hard-blocking.
- **Awareness (not bugs):** coins-redeem-after-charge failure logs CRITICAL for manual
  reconciliation; HYP "verified=false but paid" is logged paid-but-stuck; background work in
  store-accept runs after the 200 response so failures never reach the client.

## Recipe — add a field to an order, end-to-end
1. **Customer app** — add it where the cart payload is built (`stores/cart` `getCartData`).
2. **Server** — accept it in the `orderDoc` build inside `POST /api/order/create`. Decide
   explicitly whether it also belongs in the `customers.orders[]` snapshot (usually **no** —
   the snapshot is deliberately minimal and never updated).
3. **Consumers** — partner display, driver app, admin monitoring, as needed.
4. **Verify** — `npm run lint` (0 errors), `npm run routes:check` if routes moved, tests via
   the `shoofi-testing` cover-changes skill. **One PR per repo**, cross-linked.

## Definition of done
Inherit `_shared-guardrails.md` §7. Here specifically: for any change near a transition,
state which statuses can reach/leave the path and confirm you didn't weaken a guard; prefer
the `investigate-order` skill for diagnosis; never claim `smoke` passed without infra; fix
the doc + `context/assert/orders.assert.json` in the same PR if you find drift.
